    "### Note on  Streaming\n",
    "Streaming is something that is rapidly advancing and changin fast, there are multipl enew libraries every year, new and different services always popping up, and what is in this notebook may or may not apply to you. Maybe your looking for something specific on Kafka, or maybe you are looking for streaming about twitter, in which case Spark might be overkill for what you really want. Realistically speaking each situation is going to require a customized solution and this course is never going to be able to supply a one size fits all solution. Because of this, I wanted to point out some great resources for Python and Spark StreamingL\n",

    "Spark has pretty well known Streaming Capabilities, if streaming is something you've found yourself needing at work then you are probably familiar with some of these concepts already, in which case you may find it more useful to jump straight to the official documentation here:\n",

    "\n",
    "For those of you new to Spark Streaming, let's get started with a classic example, streaming Twitter! Twitter is a great source for streaming because its something most people already have an intuitive understanding of, you can visit the site yourself, and a lot of streaming technology has come out of Twitter as a company. You don't access to the entire \"firehose\" of twitter without paying for it, but that would be too much for us to handle anyway, so we'll be more than fine with the freely available API access.\n",

    "In order to use all of this though, we need to setup a Developer API acocunt with Twitter and create an application to get credentials. Review the video for instructions on how to do this or if you are already familiar with it, just get the credentials from: \n",
    "\n",
    "    https://apps.twitter.com/\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once you have that you also need to install python-twitter, a python library to connect your Python to the twitter dev account.\n",

    "You probably won't be able to run this example and then previous in the same notebook, you need to restart you kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by running the LiveStreamingTweets.py file. Make sure to add your own IP Adress and your credential keys."
